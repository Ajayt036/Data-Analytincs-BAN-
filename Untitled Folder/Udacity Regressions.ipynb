    "#### A. A scatter plot has three meaures:\n",
    "- Strenth: Strong or Weak\n",
    "- Direction: Positive or negative\n",
    "- Correlation coffiecent : Value\n",

    "\n",
    "#### B. QUESTION: If correlation coffiecent is 0. Does it mean there is no relations ship between two variables?\n",
    " - Answer is False\n",
    " - Correlation coffecent talks about linear relationship only, not general relationship. 0 value means there is no linear relation ship. However there will be some general relationship.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. A scatter plot and a correlation coefficient give the same information, so if we have this number, we don't really need a visual anymore.\n",
    "- Answer is False\n",
    "- That's right! Although the correlation coefficient and the scatter plot provide some of the info (details about the strength and direction), often an image provides much more information.\n"
